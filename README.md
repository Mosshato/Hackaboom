My first hackaton experience,  where in 2 days me and my teammate created a demo clone for OLX, where an user can create an account, can post an announce, can see others
announces based on a feed and a live map.Besides that, an user can seal a deal with other users, add announces to favorites, delete announces and so on.
As stack we used node.js for backend and java vanilla with html and css for frontend.
